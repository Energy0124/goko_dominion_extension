Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
goko / funsockets' dominion game.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has
- # details about the deck of each player

The extension displays card counts / points to the user.

It also works as chat bot making the information available to other users.
At the beginning of each game the commands are announced.


Will set this up on the Chrome webstore when it's a bit more stable.
